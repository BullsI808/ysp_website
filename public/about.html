      <h2>Youth Service Project</h2>
      <p>Youth Service Hawai‘i began in 1996 with the idea of preparing students for their role as citizens of Hawai'i and the world. Today Youth Service Hawai‘i is a 501(c)(3) corporation, serving educators across the state with service-learning resources.
 
        Youth Service Hawai‘i actively works to build awareness of the potential of service-learning as a catalyst for youth, giving information to students, educators and community members. Youth Service Hawai‘i supports the efforts of teachers, students, and community organizations in their development of service-learning through programs that build capacity and a lasting infrastructure for service-learning practice in the State.
