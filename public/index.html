    Youth Philanthropy Board- The Youth Philanthropy Board The Youth Philanthropy Board, comprised of students across Hawai‘i, is a vital part of the nonprofit Youth Service Hawaii. Students attend a workshop during which they hear from a variety of non-profit organizations, community activists and others working with social issues facing our community and they learn about grant writing. The goal of the board is to learn about our communities' critical needs and then take action with others by developing projects/grant proposals that will help address these problems. The Youth Philanthropy Board members review the grants submitted by students and makes decisions as to which proposals are awarded grants of up to $750 per project.
