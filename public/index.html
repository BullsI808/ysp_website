   <h2> Youth Philanthropy Board</h2> 
  
   <p>The Youth Philanthropy Board The Youth Philanthropy Board, comprised of students across Hawai‘i, is a vital part of the nonprofit  </p> 
  <p> Youth Service Hawaii. Students attend a workshop during which they hear from a variety of non-profit organizations, community </p> 
  <p>activists and others working with social issues facing our community and they learn about grant writing.    The goal of the board    </p> 
  <p>is to learn about our communities' critical needs and then take action with others by developing projects/grant proposals that will </p> 
  <p> help address these problems. The Youth Philanthropy Board members review the grants submitted by students and makes decisions as      </p> 
  <p>to which proposals are awarded grants of up to $750 per project.  </p>
